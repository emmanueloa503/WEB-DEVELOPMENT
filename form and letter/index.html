         <p>Dear MannY Rodrigues,</p> 
            <p>The modified format is a bit hard to remember 
                because not everything is left-justified. 
                The addressee, salutation, and the body of the 
                letter are left justified, while the sender’s address, 
                date, complimentary close, and signature are aligned to the right.
            </p> 

            <p>
                In the example below, there are two spaces between the sender’s address 
                and the date when the letter was written and three spaces between the recipient’s 
                address and salutation. There are also two spaces between the first paragraph of 
                the letter body and salutation and two spaces for every new paragraph.
            </p>

            <p>
                The complimentary close, signature, and the last paragraph of the letter are all 
                two spaces apart.
            </p>
            <p> 
            Sincerely,<br>
            L.O.G<br>
            Louis Gambino</p>

Exercise: Create a Letter

Introduction

In this exercise, we would like you to try to write a 
standard business letter organized using HTML block elements.

Instructions

The letter should have the following content:

[Your Name] [Street Address] [City, St Zip]

[Today's Date]

[Name of Recipient] [Title] [Company] [Address] [City, St Zip]

Dear [Name of Recipient]: (If unknown, use To Whom It May Concern:)

[Short introduction paragraph, stating purpose]

[Additional information]

[Closing information, summary or thank you as appropriate]

Sincerely,

(Sign here for letters sent by mail or fax)

[Your Name] [Title – if applicable]

Try to think about how to mix in semantic tags like <main> 
in the letter. There are several "right" ways to accomplish 
this task, don't overthink it!
